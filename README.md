Juicy palette picker randomly generates a new palette for you, allows you to save that palette to a project, and then save that project to a backend database built with node and express. I aimed to learn more about the back-end side of development, while also flexing some unique muscles with my css. I feel that in it's current state, it's a vast departure from most of the other projects in my portfolio and am excited to continue working on it over the next few weeks. Getting complimentary palettes and properly saving them to the express server would be really rad and super useful when on the job.
